  <h1>🌌 Planetary Longevity Theory</h1>

  <h2>🌀 Why Age Differs on Each Planet</h2>
  <p>Each planet in our solar system takes a different amount of time to complete one orbit around the Sun. This orbital period defines what we call a "year" on that planet. For example, Mercury takes only 88 Earth days to complete a year, while Pluto takes 248 Earth years. If your age were based on a planet's local year, you'd age differently depending on where you live.</p>

  <h2>🧬 Synchronization of Human Body to Planetary Frequency</h2>
  <p>Humans on Earth are synchronized to the planet's 24-hour day-night cycle and 365.25-day orbit. If we were to colonize another planet and synchronize our biological systems to that planet's gravity and frequency (like we are to Earth's 7.83 Hz Schumann resonance), our bodies would adjust accordingly. On Pluto, you would age slowly in Earth time but normally in Pluto time.</p>

  <h2>🚀 Impact on Life and Population</h2>
  <p>If people lived on Pluto with Earth-like birth rates and death rates based on Pluto years, they'd live hundreds of Earth years. This extended life expectancy could lead to higher population densities over time. However, harsh environments and dome-based habitat limitations would help regulate growth.</p>

  <h2>📊 Biological Implications</h2>
  <p>Living under different gravitational conditions and planetary rhythms may impact our biology, including muscle growth, aging rate, mental function, and immune system behavior. Artificial gravity or frequency regulation in the dome could help maintain Earth-like biological function.</p>

  <h2>🪐 Colonization Outlook</h2>
  <p>Colonizing planets like Mars or Pluto under controlled conditions means syncing human biology with the local planetary system — from gravity to time cycles. This makes it possible to maintain health and potentially extend lifespan in Earth years while adapting to a new home world.</p>
