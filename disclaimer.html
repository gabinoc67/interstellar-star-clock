    <h1>LEGAL DISCLAIMER</h1>

    <p>
      The contents of this website and simulation, including but not limited to diagrams, visual systems, equations, theories, schematics, and code related to warp drive propulsion, gravitational field navigation, time synchronization, and interstellar travel, are part of an ongoing theoretical research project.
    </p>

    <p>
      These materials represent speculative concepts in theoretical physics and applied innovation and are not intended for use in real-world aerospace or mechanical engineering applications. These ideas are strictly theoretical and experimental. Any attempt to replicate, build, test, or apply these concepts in physical form is done entirely at your own risk.
    </p>

    <p>
      We are not responsible if any individual or company attempts to build a warp drive based on this theory, nor for any type of accidents, injuries, damages, or unintended consequences arising from such attempts.
    </p>

    <p>
      I, Gabino Casanova, the creator and originator of this theory, make no guarantees or assurances of safety, accuracy, or performance in any form of experimental implementation. I am not responsible or liable for any injuries, damages, accidents, or technical malfunctions resulting from any attempt to apply or develop this theory.

    <p>
      A patent has been filed for this system and its core methodologies. These concepts are protected under U.S. intellectual property law. This invention may not be used, reproduced, reverse-engineered, developed, or commercialized in any manner without the express written consent of the patent owner. Unauthorized use will result in legal action.
