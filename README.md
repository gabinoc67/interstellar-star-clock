# 🌌 Planetary Clocks & Warp Drive Control — First Step Toward Warp 1

**Author:** Gabino Casanova  
**Patent Pending:** Filed July 2025

This repository hosts the **Planetary Clocks & Warp Drive Control** project — a combination of **real-time planetary clock tracking** and a **custom warp drive control simulator**. It presents the **first realistic step toward Warp 1**, integrating **Einstein’s equations**, the **Alcubierre warp metric**, and a **multi-clock timing control architecture (C1–C5)** that stabilizes a warp bubble for FTL-style travel.

## 📜 Summary

Most warp concepts (from Alcubierre 1994 to later “warp ring” refinements) focus on **energy and geometry** but largely ignore **time synchronization drift** inside the bubble.

This project treats **time as a control variable** (not just a measurement), actively synchronizing five clocks to keep the bubble in phase while navigating to **moving planetary targets**. It also couples propulsion with **human survivability** (frequency, atmosphere, gravity) so arrival conditions remain Earth-equivalent.

## 🚀 How Our Warp Theory Differs

1. **Time as Control** — Synchronized time drives geometry (bubble stability), not vice-versa.  
2. **C1–C5 Clock Architecture** — Five clocks actively prevent phase collapse during accel/decel.  
3. **CST Equilibrium + Planet Timing** — Arrival matches departure in Earth time, even with a moving target.  
4. **Survivability-First** — Destination “dome” matches Earth’s atmosphere, gravity vectoring, frequency/time cues.  
5. **Engineering Pathway** — Fusion/nuclear base power + superconducting coils + curvature shaping (implementable steps).

## 🔧 Simulator (v3.5) — Key Variables & Features

**File:** `warp_control_even_grid_v3_5.html`

- **Warp Level:** `warpLevel` (1–10) → curve height `curveHeight`, travel time `durationMs`  
- **Trajectory Canvas:** `trajectoryCanvasId` (bold white vectors; Earth fixed; destination labeled; Pluto supported)  
- **Ship Animation:** position `shipPos` along curve from `computeCurve(curveHeight)`; `arrivalGlow` on arrival  
- **Clocks Panel:**  
  - `CSTClock` (C1 — Earth anchor)  
  - `planetClock` (C2 — destination local time)  
  - `ibtClock` (C3 — Interstellar Beacon Time)  
  - `ugtClock` (C4 — Universal Galactic Time)  
  - `qClock` (C5 — quantum sync)  
  - `deltaT` = `T_ship - T_CST` (ns)  
- **Safety Metric:** `safetyMetric = max(a_tid/a_allow, J/J_limit)` → “Safe” if ≤ 1  
- **Controls:** `engageButton`, `resetButton` (enabled post-arrival), `screenshotButton`, `exportCsvButton`  
- **Logs:** `angleDeg`, `durationMs`, clock deltas, safety state, warp events (CSV export)

## 📐 Equations & Technical Notes (mapped to simulator)

- **Einstein’s Field Equations**  
  `G_μν + Λ g_μν = (8πG / c^4) T_μν`  
  *Goal:* coilCurrents[] shape an effective stress–energy distribution to support a finite bubble.

- **Alcubierre Metric (Cartesian)**  
  `ds^2 = -c^2 dt^2 + [dx - v_s f(r_s) dt]^2 + dy^2 + dz^2`,  
  `r_s = sqrt((x - x_s(t))^2 + y^2 + z^2)`  
  Smooth rim:  
  `f(r_s) = [tanh(σ(r_s + R)) - tanh(σ(r_s - R))] / [2 tanh(σR)]`  
  with `v_s ← warpLevel`, `R, σ` tuned to safety.

- **Multi-Clock Control Law**  
  Objective: `J = Σ_{i=2..5} w_i (T_Ci - T_C1)^2`, with `|T_ship - T_C1| ≤ δt` (ns).  
  Control (PID form):  
  `coilCurrents[k] = Kp·ΔT + Kd·ΔT_dot + Ki·∫ΔT dt`, where `ΔT = T_ship - T_CST`.

- **Safety & Entry/Exit**  
  Curvature bound: `R_c ≳ c^2 / a_max`.  
  Jerk-limited ramps: `|d^3 x_s / dt^3| ≤ J_limit`, `|d^2 f / dt^2| ≤ κ_limit`.  
  Displayed: `safetyMetric` (≤ 1 → safe).

- **Trajectory & Timing**  
  Curve: `γ(u) = (1-u)^2 P0 + 2(1-u)u C + u^2 P1`, `u ∈ [0,1]` with `curveHeight = C_base · [1 - (warpLevel/10)]`.  
  Velocity profile: jerk-limited S-curve;  
  `durationMs = 1000 · ∫_0^1 ||γ'(u)|| / uDot(t(u)) du`.  
  Arrival: stop `updateClocks()`.

- **Moving Target Intercept**  
  From `computeEphemeris()`: choose `r_s(t), v_s(t)` s.t. `r_s(t_f) = r_p(t_f)`, minimizing `(t_f - t_0)` with safety/time constraints.
