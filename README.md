Interstellar Star Clock: Universal Time for Galactic Exploration
# 🌌 Interstellar Star Clock

The **Interstellar Star Clock** is a timekeeping system designed for human and extraterrestrial coexistence across galaxies. Based on **Central Standard Time (CST)** and synchronized with Earth’s natural frequency (Schumann Resonance ~7.83 Hz), this clock allows biological life to maintain equilibrium while traveling or living on other planets.

## 🧭 Purpose

This project explores how a CST-based interstellar time standard can:
- Synchronize human biology across space environments
- Enable interplanetary and interstellar travel without aging effects
- Provide a shared reference time for alien civilizations and Earth-based operations
- Support future **warp drive**, **colonization**, and **time dome habitat** systems

---

## 🛠 Features

- 🌍 Earth CST clock with real-time updates
- 🪐 Designed to expand to planetary/local galactic time
- ⚙️ Simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript codebase for customization
- 🌌 Future integrations: quantum clocks, galaxy expansion timers, and dome sync tools

---

## 🚀 Technology Stack

- HTML5
- CSS3 (space-themed)
- JavaScript (for real-time CST simulation)

## 🧪 Coming Soon

- Planetary dropdown selector  
- CST-to-local planet time converter  
- Intergalactic expansion time countdown  
- AI-synced biological rhythm interface
